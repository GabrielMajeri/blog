## Description

This is the main page of my blog.
I am computer science student from Romania with a passion for open source software.

My hope is that the articles I write will be useful to you.
I want to write interesting posts on digital tech, life philosophy and anything else that comes to my mind.

**Schedule**: I try to write a new blog post every week.

**Disclaimer**: All opinions are my own.
