**Welcome!** This blog contains my thoughts on culture, technology, science, education and learning.

I am a computer scientist, who then became a mathematician, who is currently a physics PhD student, from Romania with a passion for writing open source software and sharing his knowledge with the world. I hope the articles I write will be useful to you.

All opinions are my own.
