# Personal Blog

This repo contains the source files for my [personal blog](https://blog.gabrielmajeri.ro).

Uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Development instructions

First, you'll need to have the appropriate version of the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language installed. My recommendation is to use a version manager, such as [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

To install all of the required dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

To start a local development server, use the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

A development server with a live preview of your changes will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
