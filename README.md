# Personal Blog

This repo contains my blog.

It is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator to convert Markdown files to HTML.

I use [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) to edit the posts before publishing them.

If you want to build the blog locally (on Linux), you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, then you can use the `run.sh` script to download and run the container with Jekyll.
